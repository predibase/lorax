# Metrics

Prometheus-compatible metrics are made available on the default port, on the `/metrics` endpoint.

Below is a list of the metrics that are exposed:
| Metric Name                                  | Type      |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `lorax_request_count`                        | Counter   |
| `lorax_request_success`                      | Counter   |
| `lorax_request_failure`                      | Counter   |
| `lorax_request_duration`                     | Histogram |
| `lorax_request_queue_duration`               | Histogram |
| `lorax_request_validation_duration`          | Histogram |
| `lorax_request_inference_duration`           | Histogram |
| `lorax_request_mean_time_per_token_duration` | Histogram |
| `lorax_request_generated_tokens`             | Histogram |
| `lorax_request_input_length`                 | Histogram |

For all histograms, there are metrics that are autogenerated which are the metric name + `_sum` and `_count`, which are the sum of all values for that histogram, and the count of all instances of that histogram respectively.
